    "Since 2000, Syriatel has been the leading  Syrian mobile telecommunication company. The company believes in offering high quality products and services to it customers to meet the need of making life easier at a reasonable price. However, the company is facing a challenge of increased customer churn which has been observed for some period of time. The increased customer churn rates have negatively affected the company's revenue demanding a comprehesive understanding of the root causes. Hence for Syriatel to remain competitive within the Syrian telecommunication market, there is a need to identify the factors resulting in the increased customer churn rates and formulate proactive strategies to ensure they retain the active subscribers and attract new customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a data-driven strategy to help the company caddress the customer churn challenge. The project aims at building classification models to predict the likelihood of a customer terminating business with the company. By implimenting this data-driven startegy, the company can easily anticipate the probably of customer stopping business with them and formulate strategies to increase the customer's satisfaction and end up retaining the customer earlier. This strategy can drive the company to a competitive edge within the market. The project  will help the company to proactively minimize the increased customer churn rates and provide better decision-making strategies. "
